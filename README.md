FLASHCARD QUIZ 

 

This is a native Android application developed using Kotlin in Android Studio. The app is a simple flashcard quiz designed to help users test their knowledge of historical facts through a set of True or False questions. It provides a clean and easy-to-use interface that allows users to go through five questions, receive immediate feedback for each answer, and view their final score at the end. 

The app starts with a welcome screen that briefly explains the purpose of the quiz and includes a “Start” button. Users are then taken to the flashcard screen where they can answer the questions. Feedback such as “Correct!” or “Incorrect” is displayed after each response. Once all questions are answered, the user is shown a score screen with personalized feedback based on their score. 

If the user scores 3 or less, a “Retry” button is displayed, encouraging them to try again. A “Review” button allows them to see the correct answers, and an “Exit” button lets them close the app. 

This app demonstrates fundamental Android concepts including activities, intents, UI interaction, and conditional logic.
